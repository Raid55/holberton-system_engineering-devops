0. is simple, just pwd and badabim badaboum
1. is more of the same just a simple ls command
2. using cd without anything else redirects user to home dir
3. ls with option -l lets us see long format
4. ls with other options attached (ex. ls -abcdefgwhateveryouwantlmnop) in this case -a for all files including hidden files (.files)
5. ls with -n option shows us ids and group ids, can be linked with any like such ls -lan ...lol its lan like lan connection....hehe 
6. since /tmp is alredy a dir all i did was do mkdir /tmp/whateverrIWant
7. mv a file is straight foward and since i know the file is in /tmp i can just move /tmp/betty into /tmp/whatever
8. simple rm command to remove betty in her dir...sorry betty but you just have to go!!!
9. this time since /holberton is a dir to delete a dir the -r option is needed , so rm -r
10. when cd is typed it sends you back to the home dir, but when you add a - like so (cd -) it sends you back and forth to the prev dir...very nice
11. using system variables ($whatever.... at least thats why I call them im to lazy to lookup the acual name, plus if its not system variable then I wouldent want to live in a world where I CANT ACCESE MY SYSTEM VARIABLES!!! whatever) so by using it I can get the pwd and then/.. out ... ez, plus ls lets you look in certain dirs after adding  options
12. using file command here
13. using ln with the symbolic option -s, this command creates a file anyname i choose and links it to a path, programm,anything...as long as its symbolic, for hard link no need for -s
